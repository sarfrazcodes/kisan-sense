🌾 KisanSense – AI-Powered Mandi Intelligence Platform

Live Project: https://kisan-sense-pv8o.vercel.app/

KisanSense is an AI-powered agricultural market intelligence platform built to help farmers make informed selling decisions.
It provides real-time mandi prices, price trend analysis, volatility insights, weather context, and AI-based recommendations in a simple and accessible interface.

🚩 Problem Statement

Many small and marginal farmers sell their crops without access to transparent, real-time market data.
They often depend on middlemen due to lack of clear insights into:

Current mandi prices
Historical price trends
Market volatility
Future price movement
Weather impact on supply

This results in reduced bargaining power and lower income.

💡 Our Solution

The platform:
Fetches live mandi price data
Stores and structures it using a scalable backend
Generates historical price trends
Calculates volatility and market risk
Predicts near-future price movement
Integrates weather insights
Uses AI to generate simple recommendations like HOLD, SELL, or MONITOR

The goal is to support smarter selling decisions through data-backed insights.
